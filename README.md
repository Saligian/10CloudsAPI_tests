# 10CloudsAPI_tests
 Recruitment task using jsonplaceholder API

 Project uses venv. Required packages are specified in the requirements.txt file.
 Tests run on pytest framework which (if used in eg. PyCharm) has to be specified as a default test runner for
 the project (Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools -> default test runner).

 Tests have been split into two parts as the API can be called via both http and https.
